one day project - easeyourmind app

Clone the repo.
CD into the easeyourmind-folder, and do npm install && npm start in each of the sub-folders (client/server)

This is a project I made in one day, and I would love to get some feedback on it. 

The app has a breathing exercise for 60 seconds, some random generated inspiring qutoes, and a calender where you cann see NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day. 

The idea behind the app is to ease your mind, by calming down your mind, and to look at what kind of wonderful universe we all are from.
